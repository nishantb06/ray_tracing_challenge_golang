# Ray tracing challenge in Golang
The Ray Tracer Challenge A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer by Jamis Buck 
(Ray Tracer challenge)[https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracer-Challenge-Test-Driven-Renderer/dp/1680502719]

# Changelog
- Completed first chapter
    - includes factory pattern for creation of point and vector
    - understanding of structs and interfaces and how to use them
    - yet to see how to perform operator overloading in golang: Go does not support traditional operator overloading as found in some other programming languages. In Go, operator overloading is not allowed, and the behavior of operators is fixed for built-in types. This design choice simplifies the language and reduces complexity.

    However, you can achieve similar functionality in Go by defining methods with custom names to implement specific operations. This approach allows you to create methods that mimic the behavior of operators.
    - includes basic functions like dot,cross,magnitude and scalar on points and vectors
    - figured out how to write tests in golang
